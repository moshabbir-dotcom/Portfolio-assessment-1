#h1 LANDING PAGE- 
The image used on the landing page is an inversion of the "genie" logo trademarked to muscle genie and is used across all pages to allow for consistancy and brand awareness. The HEADER and FOOTER have the same image fixed in the background to give the pages the illusion of "rolling" over the background picture. Reason for inversion of "genie" picture is to allow for aesthetically pleasing colour break whilst still allowing for font colours that are visible on both backrounds as well as fallback backgrounds.

#h1 HEADER- 
Has a trademarked text logo above the website title to be the first thing the visitor sees and with the colour breaks of the site being a contrast of light and dark a "hero" colour of red has been used to draw attention to the branding.

#h1 MAIN SECTION- 
Introduces reasons and benefits to undertake a physical exercise programme and also adresses potential barriers in order to engage the visitor viewing the site. As a result the visitor should be aware of the benefits of exercise and what benefits they could achieve by undertaking a program supervised by a qualified professional.

Introduction video of short duration has been embedded into the home page in order to convey more information without causing the viewer to be bombarded with excessive text. Video file has been set to not autoplay and muted with controls for a better UX.

#h1 FOOTER- 
As per the HEADER section it as a trademarked text logo above the website title to be the first thing the visitor sees and with the colour breaks of the site being a contrast of light and dark a "hero" colour of red has been used to draw attention to the branding and any clickable links when hovering such as the social media links and the link to the external "www.musclegenie.com" site which is going to be live before the end of 2021.

#h1 GALLERY- 
Static pictures of equipment avaialble in the private studio as well as images of commercial equipment available to potential clients to aid in engagment and further build on interest of the bespoke service. Images have been reduced in size to improve page load speed.

#h1 CONTACT PAGE- 
Basic level contact information for a callback or follow up email with requests for key information that a specialist personal trainer would need to be aware of before discussing suitable programmes.

#h1 TESTING-
Tested through W3C code tester for HTML and W3C for CSS with no errors. <!--Expand media query work--!>

#h2 BUGS- 
Formatting issues with CSS due to default browser margins affecting code written for benefits section on the main page as well as header and footer sections. This was solved by setting a border box and sdjusting each section individually dependant on amount of content whilst keeping overall uniformity of website.

#h2 DEPLOYMENT-
<!--Enter screenshots of working site in this section-->

#h1 CREDITS- Code for the form was resused from my challenge 2 submission at the end of the running walkthrough. This was then adjusted and added to in order to make it relevant for what the CONTACT page was trying to achieve.

#h2 CONTENT & MEDIA-
All photos and videos are copyright of Muscle Genie and used with permission of owner.

#h2 OPPORTUNITIES- 
As more specialist health & fitness services begin to be offered the contact form can be updated with the options that are looking to be offered in the future such as fire cupping/ Hijama and other complimentary therapys.

When the complimentary therapies are launched, a online diary booking facility could be implemented.

Website storage would be reduced by using an iframe URL as opposed to the locally stored video file.

Not all images were able to be compressed due to free compression software not supporting file sizes greater than 5mb. Before deployment as a functioning site this would be addressed.

        Undertaking a fitness programme can be a  daunting experience with poor self esteem sometimes being the catalyst to start and on occasion also becoming the barrier when exercising in public. Combining this with being unsure of what to do or not getting results desired when others are can be extremely disappointing. This no longer has to be the case as there is another solution..... <strong><em>Bespoke private </em>personal training!</strong>
        <br>
        Why not achieve the results you want with a personalised program designed by a level 4 personal trainer with 15yrs experience in the industry in private 1-to-1 or 1-to-2 sessions in a fully air conditioned and COVID safe environment?
